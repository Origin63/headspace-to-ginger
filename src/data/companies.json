They purchased 200 codes in Feb '18 and they have a cost sharing model so EEs contribute to a portion of the cost. We have about 10 NHS clients right now. They just closed in Q1 and launched in 2/1/18. Why they bought: they were aligning with other NHS so combat staff being overworked and stressed but their launch hasn't elicited much uptake so our save plan is below:\n\nSave Plan: Char to intro me to revamp their launch (week of 4/16/18) but we are going to keep comms with them via web/ex and phone bc their TAV is $2.2K IE too low for a F2F meet. I am going to push webinars ro EEs, physical space and our wellness program to increase their subs.\n\n4/13/18 ML - Just assigned the account.

Good oppportunity with Themed webinars \n*Aviva has been a long standing customer with Headspace. Tough negotiations with Procurement but signed a 2 year contract \nAviva solus : a separate arm of the business that had Headspace for free as part of the 7% of the contract last year.

TV screens up with messages, posters but don’t like flyers bc hot desks for most users. 300+ health hero’s  who run health activities to their local sights with leads at each site with no training (walking groups, running groups, fruit deliveries, etc). Weekly live web stream from their Sr leaders who talk about business. \n- preference on not seeing last activity for users bc she thinks that’s so granular of  personal information for users.\n- she is very into employee assessments/ questionnaires. On an annual basis. And for an net new users. \n- she wants to keep emails to uses limited and they use channels for all EE communications. \n\n4/9/18 ML - CN email verified pg: https://www.headspace.com/avivacanada\n\n3/26/18 ML - KT with Lauryn and Char:\n- 2K renewals coming up (all those that signed up last year) will take us to 4.6K subs redeemed but 2K being offered to Canadian team - will take us to 5.6K redeemed. May Mental Health Awareness - internally they are doing a big push around HS. \n- Webinar on 16th May - will boost further engagement by estimated 500. Further webinar to come after that. Date TBD - further 500 used up. \n- Another 1K hopefully reached by other activities the company is running internally and goal to get to 8/10K redeemed by July\n- Customer Interview w/ Randhir in CF\n- Contract Details: They do not have a contract date. They paid us upfront for 10,000 subs on the premise that they will not expire. \n- Code Details: They have email verification for their codes \n \nLocation of office(s) that was initially launched \nHow does the customer define success? What they were hoping to gain from introducing mindfulness? Do they have expectations of ROI or VOI to their management team? What are the engagement expectations?\nWhy did they buy (Culture/structural changes, opening/closing offices, M&A)?\nWhat are their plans for expansion of Headspace? (e.g. “entire company” or “start with US then expand to Germany” or “small pilot and then expand?”)\nHave they launched similar wellness programs? Adoption rates for other wellness programs? Timelines of wellness programs? How do they market their current wellness programs? When does their annual health Open Enrollment begin?\nAre there any current challenges exist or blockers or competitors in environment?\nWhat are company marketing channels? Do they want posters, email communications, SWAG, etc? Do they have wellness champions?\nWhen does their Fiscal year begin?\n\nDMs:\nUK:\n- Debbie Bullock: (UK) Wellbeing Lead (D2D), Responsible for budget in the UK and generally working with the team on activation (head of wellness and main POC)\n- Jenna Haines: (UK) People Function | Wellbeing, lead of the be-mindful work stream.

I've tried establishing a monthly meeting a couple of times and there is little traction. They said after their most recent renewal that they did not sign another multi-year agreement because they aren't confident which benefits they are keeping in 2023, and it seemed Headspace would be on the chopping block. They've had multiple points of contact for Headspace in less than 12 months (Dvora, then Nicole, and then Sarah) and I think being tossed around and having budget interests in other programs is pushing things to be at-risk. They haven't used any events or service credits so far in 2022.\n\n3/7/2022 (SS):\n- don't have a calendar, but are meeting this week\n>> MHAM in May, weekly comms to highlight their benefits\n>> wellness challenge (physical fitness) \n\n- MHAM\n>> what can we do to support them?\n>> service credits?\n>> communications?\n\nRenewal:\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BuNNq-9Bfq3mc5D4mLK4kQnQPBhvY68ywvHUxLReelg/edit?usp=sharing\n\n1/17/2022 (SS): Renewal check in (call)\n- global merge update from Prod team\n- only moving forward with a 1-year renewal\n- procurement/contracting elements?\n>> Order Form\n\n- delivered as a word doc \n- Jessica Avalon and John Gross\n- AdobeSign from Headspace and sent to Brittney and Angie\n- February 15th\n\n- 2022 Calendar sent to Brittney \n\n1/26/2022 (SS): Renewal check in (email)\n- update on global merge option (done by end of June)\n- check in on renewal conversations (we renew in 3 weeks)\n- 2022 Content & Themes Calendar flag \n\n\n07/27/2021 (SS): Introduction call with BCG\n- Introductions/get to know you\n--> Angie has been with BCG for 6-years, and BCG has doubled in size (7,000 in the US) \n--> mental health is a huge focus for them especially after covid, and they know there are different entry points that employees could take care of their mental health\n--> have strategic points throughout the year where they promote their mental health benefits \n--> ran a wellness challenge last year and they could earn points through their meditations, MHAM was focused on mindful eating \n--> small and lean team and don't have the bandwidth to do a lot of comms, have a monthly newsletter \n--> annual enrollment brochure is also a main channel of communicating about benefits\n--> also have an intranet page (this is where they enroll in Headspace), digital signage, and all-company meetings\n--> Brittney owns the eligibility file (once a week) and have a new hire deck and includes info on Headspace\n----> record an intro to Headspace session for new hires\n\n- other programs?\n--> EAP, clinical support through benefits provider (Aetna), teladoc, LinkedIn Learning, and ShatterProof (addiction education)\n\n- Nicole informed me there were some technical difficulties with the eligibility file recently but it sounds like all of that has been resolved, is that right?\n--> 80 people on their Pending Removal list on July 27th\n--> good feedback on removal list\n\n- I worked with BCG Hong Kong, Annie Cao, to implement Headspace and they are finishing up the agreement this week.\n--> 300 \n- global team has had discussions with Maya in the past about combining contracts -- pricing of all the different groups thats there (one director is in the US - Karen Shine, and Mark Kelly sits UK) \n--> Bright House should have ended at the end of the past year because they merged into the BCG benefits plan (may be a contract for the out of US employees) \n\n- Engagement Plan check-in\n\n- regular touch point\n\n\n7/7/2021 (SS): BCG HongKong meeting\n- 300 employees based on their historical (800 employees total, but the team is growing quickly) \n- NA team (Brittany and Angie) said the $42 USD is the \"set price\" (???)\n--> they have a global wellbeing team in Europe that Annie has access to \n--> south east Asia has set it up recently (connect with Nicole) \n--> their legal team would need to look at the general MSA\n- other offices have gotten access to Headspace \n- they have a call with finance tomorrow \n- screenshots of the user experience \n- 1-week implementation\n- interested in an eligibility file\n- how many devices? FIVE\n- additional languages? can't give roadmap \n- admin portal, insights example, marketing material examples \n- by end of day tomorrow \n\nNicole & Sarah KT:\n- population management includes adding new landing pages for BCG's locations (occurs once or twice a quarter)\n--> in the midst of adding their Hong Kong office, in discovery phase so will need to pitch the value of Headspace and what the implementation process, did not receive pricing\n--> said they're looking at Calm too \n--> there's an international MSA and Nicole put that person in touch with them\n--> haven't asked about APAC languages\n--> the way the MSA works, they are under the umbrella of the North America MSA and then are billed at the $42 price point as stated in NA's New Biz MSA\n\n- have technical challenges:\n--> just transitioned from grace period to graceful exit\n--> there's 900 people on their removal list and the admin is concerned, nicole told them its our bad and were lingering from when we made the switch (Nicole will manage)\n--> uses EP heavily\n--> opportunity with webinars and themed campaigns\n\n>The management of this account is mainly implementing landing pages for BCG locations per their MSA/SOW. Each location gets their own landing page and billed at the same price point as North America. You will work directly with their location leads. \n>Second to that, BCG values product roadmap and resource updates. Most of our calls are around strategy for events and assets. \n>BCG is one of the few customers who moved from grace period to graceful exit. They have had a number of technical challenges as a result.\n>BrightHouse is a child account to BCG North America. Angie and Brittney are the same contacts for this account, but due to how small they are, you won't need to meet about them except at renewal.\n>Dvora is another great resource for this account","publicity_rights":"None","recent_conversion_date":"2020-08-03T22:45:43.551Z","recent_conversion_event_name":"What 2020 is teaching us about workplace mental health : Trends Report","recent_deal_amount":"122271.499662","recent_deal_close_date":"2022-02-15T08:00:00Z","recent_news_trends__c":null,"reference__c":"false","reference_contact__c":null,"reference_date__c":null,"reference_externally__c":null,"referred_by__c":null,"renewable_amount__c":null,"renewal_date_psm_entered__c":"2019-02-16","renewal_date_workflow_stamped__c":"2023-02-15","renewal_url":"https://purchase.headspace.com/add?renewalId=0068X00001BHfbIQAT","restricted_dependents__c":null,"revenue_range__c":null,"salesforce_customer_tier":"Tier 1","salesforceaccountid":"0016A000001yKiwQAE","salesforcelastsynctime":"2022-12-29T09:39:54.592Z","sdr_meeting_set_with_lead__c":"false","send_headspace_is_coming_email":"false","send_pilot_welcome_emails_all_":"false","send_pilot_welcome_emails_drip_":"false","send_pre_launch_email":"false","send_welcome_emails":"false","send_welcome_emails__all_":"false","send_welcome_emails_internal_":"false","service_launch_new__c":null,"services_to_be_launched__c":null,"sign_up_code__c":null,"site":null,"social_media_reference__c":null,"spanish_preferred__c":null,"spanish_preferred_details__c":null,"speak_on_behalf_of_headspace__c":"NO","speak_with_prospective_customers__c":"NO","specifics_on_lead_source__c":null,"state":"MA","subsidiary__c":"100 - Headspace, Inc.","success_failures__c":null,"sync_to_hubspot_account__c":"false","target_account_2019__c":"false","target_account__c":"false","tax_id__c":null,"team_all_hands_presentation_webinar__c":"0","tech_savviness__c":null,"terminusaccountlists__c":"INT Post-Sale Target Accounts","terminusaccountlistsupdatedmomentutc__c":"2021-03-03T00:26:53Z","themed_webinars__c":"0","third_party_administrator__c":null,"timezone":"America/New_York","title_match_accounts__c":"false","total_active_revenue__c":"122271.499662","total_active_seat_months__c":"101400","total_active_seats__c":"8450","total_covered_lives__c":null,"total_money_raised":null,"total_revenue":"533037.4996676","total_won_recurring_revenue__c":"509371.5","trending_intent__c":null,"twitter_handle__c":null,"twitterbio":null,"twitterfollowers":null,"twitterhandle":"BCG","type":"Customer","type_of_employer__c":null,"type_of_plan__c":null,"uniquewebvisitorsrolling30__c":"78","us_only_account__c":"false","virtual_meditation_session__c":"0","voluntary_benefits__c":null,"web_technologies":"amazon_s3;google_analytics;amazon__cloudfront;google_tag_manager;shopify;marketo","website":"bcg.com","webvisitdatauptodateasof__c":"2021-08-03","webvisitsrolling30__c":"113","what_of_covered_lives_own_a_smartphone__c":null,"whitelisting_it_contact__c":null,"worker_type__c":null,"zip":"02210"},"createdAt":"2018-02-26T13:20:51.895Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-29T14:02:59.305Z","archived":false}}

Charlotte has sent over new contract and Payton created relaunch deck for Kevin to use internally with leadership.

Hasn't had time to make HS a priority because Dave Thompson, who was supposed to help him, ended up leaving company. He's a people person, cares deeply about his employees, and wants to support them in any way that he can.\n\n- Company Structure & Culture: \nDispersed org across Europe. Located in Spain, UK, Russia, France, all over. 300 employees in IS department. If they wanted to take HS out of this department they'd have to get HR involved, which could create new roadblocks. \nDoing internal stress surveys.\n\n- Use Case: \n2017 company went through massive reorg, transitioned a lot of people into new roles and new locations, and had some layoffs. Company is aware that employees are stressed out and need to find a way to reengage them.\n\n- Adoption/Engagement Status:\nNot seeing the adoption Nissan wants.","publicity_rights":null,"recent_conversion_date":"2021-08-14T08:00:22.197Z","recent_conversion_event_name":"LinkedIn Lead Generation Ad: p-emea-ent_hr-demo_codes-static-lf-auto-v2","recent_deal_amount":"8449.2798852","recent_deal_close_date":"2017-06-08T07:00:00Z","recent_news_trends__c":null,"reference__c":"false","reference_contact__c":null,"reference_date__c":null,"reference_externally__c":null,"referred_by__c":null,"renewable_amount__c":null,"renewal_date_psm_entered__c":"2018-06-07","renewal_date_workflow_stamped__c":"2018-06-07","renewal_url":null,"restricted_dependents__c":null,"revenue_range__c":null,"salesforce_customer_tier":"n/a","salesforceaccountid":"0016A000001yJUGQA2","salesforcelastsynctime":"2022-12-27T16:47:18.133Z","sdr_meeting_set_with_lead__c":"false","send_headspace_is_coming_email":"false","send_pilot_welcome_emails_all_":"false","send_pilot_welcome_emails_drip_":"false","send_pre_launch_email":"false","send_welcome_emails":"false","send_welcome_emails__all_":"false","send_welcome_emails_internal_":"false","service_launch_new__c":null,"services_to_be_launched__c":null,"sign_up_code__c":null,"site":null,"social_media_reference__c":null,"spanish_preferred__c":null,"spanish_preferred_details__c":null,"speak_on_behalf_of_headspace__c":null,"speak_with_prospective_customers__c":null,"specifics_on_lead_source__c":null,"state":"mk","subsidiary__c":"100 - Headspace, Inc.","success_failures__c":null,"sync_to_hubspot_account__c":"false","target_account_2019__c":"false","target_account__c":"false","tax_id__c":null,"team_all_hands_presentation_webinar__c":"0","tech_savviness__c":null,"terminusaccountlists__c":null,"terminusaccountlistsupdatedmomentutc__c":null,"themed_webinars__c":"0","third_party_administrator__c":null,"timezone":"Europe/London","title_match_accounts__c":"false","total_active_revenue__c":"0","total_active_seat_months__c":"0","total_active_seats__c":"0","total_covered_lives__c":null,"total_money_raised":null,"total_revenue":"8449.2798852","total_won_recurring_revenue__c":"10774.3942871716398877837286406529","trending_intent__c":null,"twitter_handle__c":null,"twitterbio":null,"twitterfollowers":null,"twitterhandle":"NissanEurope","type":"Churned","type_of_employer__c":null,"type_of_plan__c":null,"uniquewebvisitorsrolling30__c":null,"us_only_account__c":"false","virtual_meditation_session__c":"0","voluntary_benefits__c":null,"web_technologies":"microsoft_exchange_online;salesforce;media_math;app_nexus;outlook;dstillery","website":"nissan-global.com","webvisitdatauptodateasof__c":null,"webvisitsrolling30__c":null,"what_of_covered_lives_own_a_smartphone__c":null,"whitelisting_it_contact__c":null,"worker_type__c":null,"zip":""},"createdAt":"2018-02-26T17:51:17.654Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-27T16:47:21.266Z","archived":false}}

have a very strong/long-lasting relationship with Headspace\n- They're currently in the process of planning next year's wellbeing strategy and Headspace is a big part of this plan\n- A big thing for them next year is culture and they have a lot of offices in many regions around the world and want to try and include as many as possible in any content Headspace can provide\n- GOAL/REQUEST: They're looking to increase engagement in as many regions as possible so they'd like to understand what we're working on in terms of language capabilities across all content\n- REQUEST: They requested for more content to be available to Asian markets (even if we did a specific webinar/live meditation for them in Chinese for example)\n-  GOAL: They want to push specific content such as stress, sleep, focus in new way ways to help increase engagement (I shared the engagement kit on stress which they seemed to really like)\n- REQUEST: They're interested in any research publications or any content we can provide any recommendations on how businesses can voice mental health support for their employees\n- REQUEST: They're interested in receiving anything on how they can voice mental health support and how they can talk about mental health internally to all staff members in the most supportive way which Headspace recommends\n\n\n07/28 MD: Their South-Wales entity went back to lockdown and they

She is working on getting information from their employees' needs to build their global wellbeing strategy.\nI don't believe she is the budget holder.\n \n\nThey have 2500 employees globally but due to our lack of languages in Asia, they focus mainly on their English-speaking employees. They hope we will have Asian languages - Trad Chinese, Jap, Korean. \nThey have 40 new hires since the pandemic.\n\nShe is the one who wanted to increase the number of licenses because they were close to full capacity but she didn't want to go with their FULL capacity of global employees' numbers because of the languages' blockers - Asia ones.\nI have set up a monthly check-in meeting + we will work on the Headspace engagement plan. Their strategy seems to be in the works.\nI have mentioned that we should do a quarterly meeting with the other DM to keep them in the loop.\n\nSuccess is defined by very high engagement rates and constant adoption - whether it's 5 or 20 new enrolled members every month -\nAesop is part of Natura which is owned by Cult Beauty.\n\nInternal Sharepoint - she will do a push with a new age up with HS + email out. I have shared the QR code to add to her communication.\n\n3/4/2021\n- renew and slightly extend licenses\n--> 1,500 employees, 1-year \n--> she has access to the global terminations but the 1,500 licenses will allow them to market it more\n--> timeline: early next week\n\n- date going forward?\n--> adjusting contracting dates March 24, 2021\n\n- April & May\n--> Catriona is working on a new wellbeing strategy and Headspace will be a big part of that\n--> April they are launching an intranet page where they will share the latest updates for Headspace/wellness \n--> MHAM in May with a big push on a webinar \n--> what countries? definitely UK & US\n--> October 10th is globally recognized\n\n- new point of contact\n--> Tomas!\n\n- she has a puppy! cross between a west highland terrier and poodle \n\n2/4/2020 (SS): Renewal call\n- Catriona (kah-tree-nah) \n--> familiar with app \n\n10/7/2020 (SS): Introduction to Headspace Webinar \n- \"In Conversation With...Headspace\" series\n- for Aus and Asia employee populations\n- got great feedback and co-hosted with Emma\n\n10/5/2020 (SS) - Meeting with Emma\n- confirm employee headcount?\n- webinar: they sent the link through to their internal intranet where they can sign up for headspace \n--> callum told me this morning that there are 300-400 employees just in EMEA, and that Asia and Australia are much larger.

Asking to reschedule for next week.\n\nJoined 2014. Aesop just renewed last quarter.\n\nAccount Notes:\nEmployer discount. Employees sign up, we pull month report, and then we bill them.\n\nThey are similar to Google in that we bill them monthly for subs redeemed, which is why you see monthly opportunities on Salesforce. They pay $65/sub and are a legacy. New point of contact and potential opportunity to relaunch and increase adoption.","publicity_rights":null,"recent_conversion_date":"2022-09-05T07:23:55.259Z","recent_conversion_event_name":"RU OK Day Webinar | Headspace for Work: Live Webinar Form (H4W)","recent_deal_amount":"36382.5","recent_deal_close_date":"2022-03-24T07:00:00Z","recent_news_trends__c":null,"reference__c":"false","reference_contact__c":null,"reference_date__c":null,"reference_externally__c":null,"referred_by__c":null,"renewable_amount__c":null,"renewal_date_psm_entered__c":"2019-02-28","renewal_date_workflow_stamped__c":"2023-03-24","renewal_url":"https://purchase.headspace.com/add?renewalId=0068X00001BopaQQAR","restricted_dependents__c":null,"revenue_range__c":null,"salesforce_customer_tier":"Tier 2","salesforceaccountid":"0016A000001yK7YQAU","salesforcelastsynctime":"2022-12-29T09:39:54.629Z","sdr_meeting_set_with_lead__c":"false","send_headspace_is_coming_email":"false","send_pilot_welcome_emails_all_":"false","send_pilot_welcome_emails_drip_":"false","send_pre_launch_email":"false","send_welcome_emails":"false","send_welcome_emails__all_":"false","send_welcome_emails_internal_":"false","service_launch_new__c":null,"services_to_be_launched__c":null,"sign_up_code__c":null,"site":null,"social_media_reference__c":null,"spanish_preferred__c":null,"spanish_preferred_details__c":null,"speak_on_behalf_of_headspace__c":null,"speak_with_prospective_customers__c":null,"specifics_on_lead_source__c":null,"state":"Greater London","subsidiary__c":"100 - Headspace, Inc.","success_failures__c":null,"sync_to_hubspot_account__c":"false","target_account_2019__c":"false","target_account__c":"false","tax_id__c":"56 007 409 001","team_all_hands_presentation_webinar__c":"0","tech_savviness__c":null,"terminusaccountlists__c":"INT Post-Sale Target Accounts","terminusaccountlistsupdatedmomentutc__c":"2021-03-03T00:26:53Z","themed_webinars__c":"0","third_party_administrator__c":null,"timezone":"Europe/London","title_match_accounts__c":"false","total_active_revenue__c":"36382.5","total_active_seat_months__c":"18000","total_active_seats__c":"1500","total_covered_lives__c":null,"total_money_raised":null,"total_revenue":"207459.21722287080074","total_won_recurring_revenue__c":"167311.58","trending_intent__c":null,"twitter_handle__c":null,"twitterbio":null,"twitterfollowers":null,"twitterhandle":"AesopAgency","type":"Customer","type_of_employer__c":null,"type_of_plan__c":null,"uniquewebvisitorsrolling30__c":"1","us_only_account__c":"false","virtual_meditation_session__c":"0","voluntary_benefits__c":null,"web_technologies":"wordpress;cloud_flare;google_analytics","website":"aesop.com","webvisitdatauptodateasof__c":"2021-07-16","webvisitsrolling30__c":"1","what_of_covered_lives_own_a_smartphone__c":null,"whitelisting_it_contact__c":null,"worker_type__c":null,"zip":"W1F 9EL"},"createdAt":"2018-02-26T20:56:29.959Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-29T09:40:11.905Z","archived":false}}

Many people had trouble using the code and signing up too so they didn't know if that was a technical issue.\n- Our Audio/Visual team had reached out to do two events on their campus with a live meditation and cancelled twice. She'd done prep work for both and gotten approvals but Headspace bailed.\n\nFinal reach out: Payton sent new student pricing as Hail Mary. Carole has officially retired and received auto response. \n\n6/26 - PR - First call with Carol and Beth on 6/27.\n6/19 - POC is retiring and reached out to Brooke for career change.\nStill trying to navigate next steps. Check with Sarah/Janis to see if they’re doing anything?\n\nAccount Notes:\n\nPurchased accounts and also given access via science.\nOriginally setup as a science research partnership. Was unsuccessful for a number of reasons. POC is thinking about retiring - Carol and Beth gallagher (not equipped to run a study). \nCame on as part of larger study with our science team, but those science folks (e.g. Monica) aren’t at headspace anymore, left mid study. Megan went on maternity leave. \n\nProvided accounts as an apology.\n\nWrong post survey got sent to student population so post results were nulled\n\n250 subscriptions going to student RA's to start the semester. Landing page and multi-use code.","publicity_rights":null,"recent_conversion_date":"","recent_conversion_event_name":"","recent_deal_amount":"12983.75","recent_deal_close_date":"2017-09-01T07:00:00Z","recent_news_trends__c":null,"reference__c":"false","reference_contact__c":null,"reference_date__c":null,"reference_externally__c":null,"referred_by__c":null,"renewable_amount__c":null,"renewal_date_psm_entered__c":"2018-09-01","renewal_date_workflow_stamped__c":"2018-09-01","renewal_url":null,"restricted_dependents__c":null,"revenue_range__c":"$250M - $500M","salesforce_customer_tier":"n/a","salesforceaccountid":"0016A000001yKd4QAE","salesforcelastsynctime":"2022-11-22T03:05:49.567Z","sdr_meeting_set_with_lead__c":"false","send_headspace_is_coming_email":"false","send_pilot_welcome_emails_all_":"false","send_pilot_welcome_emails_drip_":"false","send_pre_launch_email":"false","send_welcome_emails":"false","send_welcome_emails__all_":"false","send_welcome_emails_internal_":"false","service_launch_new__c":null,"services_to_be_launched__c":null,"sign_up_code__c":null,"site":null,"social_media_reference__c":null,"spanish_preferred__c":null,"spanish_preferred_details__c":null,"speak_on_behalf_of_headspace__c":null,"speak_with_prospective_customers__c":null,"specifics_on_lead_source__c":null,"state":"CA","subsidiary__c":"100 - Headspace, Inc.","success_failures__c":null,"sync_to_hubspot_account__c":"false","target_account_2019__c":"false","target_account__c":"false","tax_id__c":null,"team_all_hands_presentation_webinar__c":"0","tech_savviness__c":null,"terminusaccountlists__c":null,"terminusaccountlistsupdatedmomentutc__c":null,"themed_webinars__c":"0","third_party_administrator__c":null,"timezone":"America/Los_Angeles","title_match_accounts__c":"false","total_active_revenue__c":"0","total_active_seat_months__c":"0","total_active_seats__c":"0","total_covered_lives__c":null,"total_money_raised":null,"total_revenue":"12983.75","total_won_recurring_revenue__c":"11985","trending_intent__c":"stress relief, emotional well being, health care benefits, stress reduction, employee experience","twitter_handle__c":null,"twitterbio":null,"twitterfollowers":null,"twitterhandle":"CalPoly","type":"Churned","type_of_employer__c":null,"type_of_plan__c":null,"uniquewebvisitorsrolling30__c":null,"us_only_account__c":"false","virtual_meditation_session__c":"0","voluntary_benefits__c":null,"web_technologies":"microsoft_exchange_online;youtube;new_relic;typekit_by_adobe;microsoft_office_365;nginx;drupal;google_analytics;amazon_s3;wordpress;crazy_egg;cloud_flare;varnish","website":"www.calpoly.edu","webvisitdatauptodateasof__c":null,"webvisitsrolling30__c":null,"what_of_covered_lives_own_a_smartphone__c":null,"whitelisting_it_contact__c":null,"worker_type__c":null,"zip":"93407"},"createdAt":"2018-02-26T23:21:32.416Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-21T18:26:29.760Z","archived":false}}

For them they are not currently exploring PEPY and happy with PPS as it works for them.\n*POC is Kate Allum who is in their wellbeing lead and now looks after Headspace. before that it wasn't really owned by anyone .\n*They have mental health first airders who often come together as Champions to promote Headspace. They can't promote Headspace all the time but try to weave it into initiaives that they have. \n* They have had Headspace for about 4 years and are on legacy pricing so each year try to increase by 5% to bring them up to that. They have now locked in the price with a MY contract which actually saw only a 1% increase due to the MY discount\n* quite low touch and have a monthly call to update on Headspace and to hear their initiatives to weave HS into\n\nAug 2021:LR:\n- Expanded to purchase more subs recently\n- Not currently interested in PEPY\n- Renewal coming up in Q4\n- Call rescheduled recently - this was a business review for engagement \n- Kate is now more focussed on wellbeing in Europe - they had a reshuffle earlier this year to prioritise. \n- Engagement is good, they are 92% adopted but only 17% MAU which is quite low of their enrolled population \n\nFocus: plan webinars to help engagement \n\n\n\n26 Sep: LR: F2F meet, the renewal will go ahead but need pen tetsing information as agreed last year at their renewal with dan & Char. \n30 min Webinar will be in November \n\n5/23 DF: Onsite lunch and learn + 10 min med\n- 35 attendees\n- good feedback from the session\n- POC was out at the last min so no meeting. Handing over to Lucy to pick up.\n\n02/18 DF: Relaunch\n- Renewal signed, re-launched on new platform (no migration, wanted to start fresh)\n- Webinar booked for next week to continue to drive adoption\n- Will be handing over to Lucy\n\n11/12 DF: Call w/Kate. \n- Discussed B2B roadmap, she's excited to be transitioned to the new dashboard. \n- Discussed renewal - she's due to sit down with the budget holder in the next few weeks to finalise\n- Verbal agreement on renewing at least the current number. - \n- Expansion to 1000 is still very much possible. Languages are key, as European office locations will drive up demand. France, Belgium and Spain have all showed interest but really demanding local language. Gave rough timelines of end of Q1/beginning of Q2.\n\n10/25 DF:\nKate cancelled our renewals/expansion call as she has an event - apologised, and we set a date for next week. Kate also asked for costs for 50% of the employee base. Sent over costs as well as PEPY.\n\n9/27/18 - DF: Monthly call w/Kate. Their wellness fair went well, had a few interesting chats with employees who were either using Headspace, or reminded them to use Headspace! Interested in Sleep, shared all our new comms for them to promote. Also shared Mental Health posters to share with their Work Ability team. RE: renewal/expansion: Kate/Caroline haven't had a chance to review yet, but they have promised a response by the time of our next checkin. \n\n8/17/18 - PR: Caroline let Char know that working with someone in LA is not ideal because of slower turnaround time. Proposing this be transferred to Dan.\n\n7/27/18 - PR: Sent out survey. Low participation. Caroline disappointed. Proposed swag for incentive.\n\n6/14 - PR: EBR with Carolyn. Engagement is good, really positive feedback. Sending list of daily reminders she can use to ping her employees. Designed survey and sent over for final review.\n\nCharlotte doing in-person Lunch & Learn on May 10th. Waiting to hear back to schedule follow-up call.\n- Need a survey to move forward with more \n\nAccount Notes:\n\nPOC: \nCaroline Shepherd - Employee Relations Specialist\n\nCulture:\n\nUse Case:\n\nLaunch/Adoption/Engagement:\n- Purchased 500, then 50. All used up\n- Originally budgeted for 1000 seats. Will buy more.

Their landing page is email verified.\n\n7/27/18 - PR: In email with Char, Preya said the team has not launched yet due to internal delays.

Its service remits ranges in complexity from secondary to tertiary level. St. James's hospital is also an academic teaching hospital. It is thus committed to the creation of an environment and the circumstances in which education and research in the health science and allied areas is possible and flourishes. The Hospital is increasingly required to operate in an environment of vertical and literal collaboration in the ultimate interest of its patients. It advocates and pursues the promotion and participation of the hospital in services and academic health networks, both nationally and internationally, in this context. While preserving the primacy of patients in all respects, the hospital recognises and accepts its responsibilities to a broader set of stockholders that include government, the public and community generally, service key purchasers, staff and the many associated institutions in the health and education sectors.

We are committed to do this through the implementation of our Environmental Management System (EMS). We have an Environmental Co-ordinator (EC) who implements and maintains the EMS, identifies where improvements can be made to environmental performance accross the business including monitoring trends, performance and competence of its entire staff, subcontractors and supply chain. We only use timber and plywood from sustainable sources and the recycled content of metal in our reinforcement is now 100%. We have implemented our EMS since April 2009 and are currently awaiting accreditation to Green Dragon level 3.

Engagement Planning Session scheduled for Sept 2021.\n\nOpportunity:\nStress Webinar in November and DE&I session\nJan Check In\nCan we get more granular detail about engagement and usage? Table - to look at the complete data and \n usage - rather than pulling out from within pdf. Ie they want the granular data\n- portfolio of engagement events& quote.\n- \n\n\n09/24 -\n- Plan is to migrate all current users to the platform (circa 1,250 but decreasing as member's codes expire) they will then have a buffer of 250 licences for those who have expired recently or for new joiners.\n- Contract is sitting with Norm - happy to sign, but it is in the queue\n- Once we have this we can start migration and re-launch\n\n\n08/20 - Migration:\nCall with Global IT Security (Gary Smith) re migration process. Agreed no risk and good to go ahead. However:\n- Unrestricted enrolment link\n- Comms in Sign Up flow will instruct to download on personal device, with personal email, and with no BoA branding. \n- Next steps: send over enrolment link, sign up flow process, with edited comms.\n- Also discussed renewal: keen to renew - send over costing, and engagement and adoption data.\n\n\n\n\nJuly update: They want to hold off renewal conversations until we have finalised conversation re migration to H4w platform. Resistant to migration. Scheduling call to discuss concerns. - 08.07\n\n6/6 DF Call with Nick + Regina\n- Regina covering Nancy's mat leave. We worked with Regina @ Morgan Stanley - she's a fan\n- Discussed migration options. They are on board. Will likely use eligibility files. Checking internally with IT on security. May need to go through additional steps.\n- Recommended they go for 1 enrolment page rather than 4 (their existing code setup)\n\nCurrent status of codes remaining:\nUK: 164\nEMEA: 150\nInterns: 0\nIreland: 94\nTotal: 408\n\n- We will migrate their 1000+ members and give additional seats to represent codes remaining. Will aim to do this after their intern event which should use up more codes\n- On board for renewal end of September. Will likely create a similar MSA to Morgan Stanley, with APAC coming on board at the same time.\n\n\n4/8 - Call w/Nick\n- MHAW activity call\n- Agreed Weds 15th: \n1. 11:30am, group meditation session to be streamed to multiple locations\n2. 12-2pm booth in London. Swag!\n\n3/25 Meeting w/ Ross - Nick, Alison in person, Andy Sherwood on phone\n- BAML consider HS vital to wellbeing strat\n- How do we optimise HS? Tie to wellness objectives and themes, back up w/ science\n- Want to target comms to specific user groups (based on usage)\n- Would love more specific in-person engagements (Ria)\n- Cohorts based on eligibility files\n- In-app surveys\n- In-platform challenges\n- Managers - how do we get them involved, educatad, and build HS into management training (Ria)\n- 6 week mindfulness programme being run in Ireland\n- Ross told them we are switching off codes. They are interested in V3. Will need to ensure we have custom fields and eligibility files to cover UK/Ire/EMEA/Int code split\n- Would like a demo of the new platform\n\n- Int\n\n\n24/1 - DF\nEmployee roadshow\n- Wellness roadshow, lots of positive comments from existing users and excitement from potential new users\n- A couple of key themes to discuss with Nancy and Nick:\n*need for meditation space. Heard this multiple times. Current prayer room setup isn't suitable.\n*general lack of awareness that Headspace is available for employees. Needs additional communication to promote availability.\n*quite a few 'downloaded, never tried'. In-line with the data, and Nick was able to hear this directly from a few employees. Good incentive to run engagement activity.\n\nOctober onsites - DF\n- Held 3 onsites, 2 in London and 1 in Chester. London sessions had around 20 in person, with 150 on webex. Chester had 8 attendees and no webex.\n- London sessions were well received with positive feedback from our POCs and attendees.\n- Chester session definitely not worthwhile. All attendees were users, and given it's a 3 hour+ journey each way, these should be done via webinar in the future.\n\n10/11/18 ML - Renewal signed. Sending it off to Dan with formal email. But client was told verbally on our Sept check in call. \n\n9/19/18 ML - Pinged again re renewal deadline to Nancy and got her out of office. Pinged Char and Dan to ensure they can nudge and step in while I am out on PTO this Thurs - Wed. \n\n9/6/18 ML - Agenda:\n- Headspace Intro Session: Sept 19th onsite at BOAML (confirmed with CH)\n- Healthy Minds campaign: would like a talk focused on anxiety or depression or sleep\nOctober 8th 10am - 11am BST \nAND\nOctober 19th 10am - 11am BST\n- Live session in Chester (close to 1,000) but they can flexible October 8th between October 19th \n- Confirmation by EOW next week\n\n- Survey: They would like to administrate a survey for users for October bc they will analyze.

Headspace team Majid Al Futtaim is a leading shopping mall, retail, residential and leisure pioneer across the Middle East, Africa and Asia. I?m overseeing at Majid Al Futtaim the continuous efforts to shape a healthier corporate culture ? fundamentally to nurture a healthy state of mind across the organization. Mindfulness, or ?be here now? as we call it over here, is I believe one foundation to help our colleagues to be at their best more often, mentally, emotionally and physically. And there is an increasing interest in the topic of mindfulness. Also, being the main provider of high-end cinemas in UAE with our brand VOX, we are at the moment in conversation to bring the new Film ?Walk with me? with Thich Nhat Hanh to cinemas in the middles east. ?Happiness? in the wider sense is a strategic topic for the UAE government, and ? needless to say ? mindfulness is a major foundation. Actively meditating myself, I?ve often wondered how to make this practice more accessible, in large numbers, to a business audience, where many might not be inclined to experience let alone practice mediation as it still considered or labelled a ?spiritual? practice, hence associated with the private space and religious space. People are wondering how to ?fit it in on top of? daily demands. Also, business culture often struggle with the intangible and non-linear side of human nature (mind, moods, soul). Stillness can be associated with non-performance. I was intrigued by the quality of you offering for various reasons, and would be curious to learn about your corporate offerings to find out of this is something we could promote in our organization. Thank you very much for letting me know who I could talk to and explore this further.

I preemptively canceled my invites, so work with Charna on a new one\nContract Call Outs:\nBeen with H4W since it’s inception pretty much - Pilot 2017 > Launch April 2019\n3- year term - 5/13/2021 - 5/12/2024\n$3.50 PEPY\n50,000 lives\nJust expanded to a multi-year in 2021 \nExpanded from PPS to PEPY under Iain about 1.5 years ago\nAlready positioned PFP to them; revisit\nNo performance guarantees, BUT they do have program milestones outlined. I recommend finding a way to track these in the partnership plan\nGOALS:\nIncrease new enrollments by 10% year over year (~4300 by end of year 3)\nIncrease engagement to 25% by May 2022, 28% by May 2023, 30% by May 2024\nMaintain a 97% employee satisfaction rating\nTACTICS: \n(Headspace) Developed promotion materials in languages supported by Headspace app\n(Headspace) Complete annual survey of those enrolled and engaged\n(Headspace) Complete annual survey of those enrolled but not engaged\n(Headspace) Provide content for Monthly Live Meditations with Eve for (Cardinal Health) to promote via internal channels and\nother communications\n(Cardinal Health) Partner with meetings and events, and communications partners to include Virtual Meditation Sessions (led by\nHeadspace) at events with more than 300 people (e.g., sales meetings)\nSOW is on Cardinal Health paper\nProgram Years:  5/13 - 5/12\nVerification Method: Unrestricted enrollment \nContacts: \nCharna Martini - Charna is a huge advocate of Headspace. She is very chill, sometimes too chill. Sometimes she’ll flake or cancel meetings. I’d be super proactive with her. LOVES the Headspace kids content.\nRelationship: Very satisfied due to move from PPS>PEPY and from 1 year> 3 year\nGoals: See contract details above\nNotable Barriers: They aren’t on eligibility files and have unrestricted enrollment due to their decentralized population and fee that they’d need to pay with their vendor to implement. Because of that, data is not 100% validated. Therefore, reporting efforts may be challenging and/or inaccurate. Continue to talk to Charna about the prospect of moving to eligibility files. \nPartnership Values: product roadmap updates, communications/marketing asset updates; I recommend being very proactive about the goals they’ve set. Especially when it comes to booking webinars.

The framework is provided but each affiliate is allowed to implement the framework for their EEs.  \n- Digital wellbeing is where HS falls. \n- Basel: Pharma and Diagnostics are not aligned well with HQ in Basel. \n[IMP] - It would be best to connect with the local BASEL team bc they are \"not onboard traditionally for promoting HS\" GUSEPEE is going to coordinate the \n- They set the standards but its up to the global affiliates on if they want to take advantage of the contract or not.  \n- They have a number of affiliates globally including Genentech BUT they try to align their wellness and benefits \n\n- Roche US and Genetech: 20,000 EEs but they have access to other TOOLS which are wellness or meditation so we need to differentiate the benefits of HS over that! \n-- David is part of the PD of Genetech\n-- Tony Morgado (Goseppi is less familiar with him) BUT Tony is part of the local wellbeing team\n\n- Eileen also manages NZ\n- Alain: basel contact BUT Guiseppee \n- The largest challenge they have with HS is that its in ENGLISH only. \n- German and French is the primary language (70%) and (30%) are english speaking in Basel: 10,000, - How many EEs in Basel? \n- How many EEs in UK? (Eileen)\n- Wellness Calendar: Global wellbeing week of September 24th and they are planning to talk about HS during these locations. \n- REASONS for ISSUES: Previous HS relationships have been kind of unresponsive which is why they are not super into promoting it. Outlined they will see this change moving forward. \n- Product Feed\n- Report scheduling: quarterly metrics reports [schedule it] AND FOR THE TEAM\n- Gamification he doesnt think its going to work\n\n5/7/18 ML - KT with Brooke and Jess.\n- They have four locations broken down by code: CCROCHEAZ1Y, CCROCHENZ1Y, CCROCHEPDB1Y, CCROCHEUK1Y (CCROCHEDIA1Y churned) and AZ has individual codes bc we didnt have email verification when they came on.\n- BRING UP EMAIL VERIFICATION AT AZ's RD in 2019!\n- They have the ability to 'roll over' their subscriptions but only for this 2018 YEAR\n- 12 pounds for all locations and we can invoice them with either dollar or pound\n\nLocation Breakdown w/ RD:\n- UK (CCROCHEUK1Y): 400 subs +190 rolled over = 590 TD subs and RD: 2/2/19. ( unused subs)\n- Pharma (CCROCHEPDB1Y): 400 subs + 67 rolled over = 467 TD subs and RD: 1/24/19. (48 unused subs)\n- Arizona (CCROCHEAZ1Y *unique codes): 20 subs, RD: 8/30/19.

Planning to meet when I am in London in May.

Sent over proposal.\n\n8/27/18 ML - Lots of planning for the Sept webinar. Finally confirmed for 9/19 at 12pm EST.\n\n6/14/18 ML -  There was a confusion on their renewal codes rolling over into 2019 from 2017. Due to the lack of clarify we will honor the remaining codes from 2017 until the close of their contract for this year (contract end date: 4/29/2019). \n\nCode breakdown below:\n- [100] 2018 Renewal Codes (CCCDSREN1Y-XXXXX): 80 remaining codes\n- [300] 2017 Codes (CCCDS1Y-XXXXX): 105 remaining codes\nTotal Remaining Codes: 185\n\n5/21/18 ML - Renewal codes sent over to Josianne and Marie-France. Pending their confirmation on engagement and adoption planning for the upcoming year. Shared Box folder with ideas. \n\n4/25/18 ML - Call with Josianne to introduce me as their CSM and they need to sign their renewal for 125 licenses. \n- They are launching a meditation room in Montreal: June 1\n- They have TVs and would like to post on their intranet about re-launch\n- They are unsure of the new champion team bc their champ left the company\n- Workplace by FB is going to replace their intranet: 4-6 weeks out\n- Relaunch around June 1\n\nFollow-up:\n- Send over example surveys for EEs [done]\n- Send over Webinar deck and dates for June  [done]\n- Send over Mental Health awareness month content [done]\n- Send over launch content [done]\n\nRenewal Details: 100 x annual subscriptions @ $60 each with a $12 employee contribution. Company pays $48\n\n4/23/18 ML - Main issue:  90% of employees working at their head office in Montreal speak French, so they had to give access to a French app and promote it as well. Thus the need for the downgrade this year. They also only budgeted 6,000 CAD this year for the HS licenses. Pending a call with client on 4/25.\n\n4/17/18 ML - Updating risk bc they will likely downgrade from 300 to 150 seats. $9,000 TAV for this renewal so a loss of $2496 TAV. Still pending admin signing. \n\n4/12/18 ML - Char is working with them on signing a new contract at $60/sub for their new contract and they downgraded from 300 seats to 150 seats. Also, sent out times for a EBR in May.\n\n4/3/18 ML - Renewal Call:\nOTC:  Josianne Martel (CDS), Jess (HS), Char (HS), Maya (HS)\nChar brought up the new product \nRenewal: They have remaining licenses right now so she wants to buy less licenses this year… what’s their usage today?\n What is their RD?\nJosianne is going to send out an email to users to try to re-engage before their RD.\nNext Steps: After they sign their renewal, I will get back on the phone with the admin and Char (Char estimates 2-3 weeks for f/u)\n\nDMs:\n- Josianne Martel: Admin, Title?... Main POC\n\n- MARIE-FRANCE MARTINEAU: Coordonnatrice administrative/Administrative Coordinator, Talents et Culture\n\n3/23/18 ML - KT with Charlotte: \nHeavily engaged customer but they have not signed a contract yet\nThey paid of 11K in subs last year. They have an employee contribution BUT they still have about 110 codes left and we need to get through those before they have a renewal conversation. \nThey are looking at expanding the program but still working through it. Happy and call on April 3: Review metrics, business update, feedback session for the admin BUT main item is focused on their renewal. Moving them to an annual contract. \nTheir head contact is in Montreal and thats their HQ","publicity_rights":null,"recent_conversion_date":null,"recent_conversion_event_name":null,"recent_deal_amount":"120","recent_deal_close_date":"2019-03-31T07:00:00Z","recent_news_trends__c":null,"reference__c":"false","reference_contact__c":null,"reference_date__c":null,"reference_externally__c":null,"referred_by__c":null,"renewable_amount__c":null,"renewal_date_psm_entered__c":"2019-04-30","renewal_date_workflow_stamped__c":"2020-02-29","renewal_url":null,"restricted_dependents__c":null,"revenue_range__c":null,"salesforce_customer_tier":"n/a","salesforceaccountid":"0016A000001yL3wQAE","salesforcelastsynctime":"2022-11-22T01:32:03.601Z","sdr_meeting_set_with_lead__c":"false","send_headspace_is_coming_email":"false","send_pilot_welcome_emails_all_":"false","send_pilot_welcome_emails_drip_":"false","send_pre_launch_email":"false","send_welcome_emails":"false","send_welcome_emails__all_":"false","send_welcome_emails_internal_":"false","service_launch_new__c":null,"services_to_be_launched__c":null,"sign_up_code__c":null,"site":null,"social_media_reference__c":null,"spanish_preferred__c":null,"spanish_preferred_details__c":null,"speak_on_behalf_of_headspace__c":null,"speak_with_prospective_customers__c":null,"specifics_on_lead_source__c":null,"state":"QC","subsidiary__c":"100 - Headspace, Inc.","success_failures__c":null,"sync_to_hubspot_account__c":"false","target_account_2019__c":"false","target_account__c":"false","tax_id__c":null,"team_all_hands_presentation_webinar__c":"0","tech_savviness__c":null,"terminusaccountlists__c":null,"terminusaccountlistsupdatedmomentutc__c":null,"themed_webinars__c":"0","third_party_administrator__c":null,"timezone":"America/Toronto","title_match_accounts__c":"false","total_active_revenue__c":"0","total_active_seat_months__c":"0","total_active_seats__c":"0","total_covered_lives__c":null,"total_money_raised":null,"total_revenue":"18514.2400900","total_won_recurring_revenue__c":"23022","trending_intent__c":null,"twitter_handle__c":null,"twitterbio":null,"twitterfollowers":null,"twitterhandle":"cirque","type":"Churned","type_of_employer__c":null,"type_of_plan__c":null,"uniquewebvisitorsrolling30__c":null,"us_only_account__c":"false","virtual_meditation_session__c":"0","voluntary_benefits__c":null,"web_technologies":"microsoft_exchange_online;unbounce;asp_net;salesforce;app_nexus;pardot;go_squared;google_analytics;twitter_button;youtube;new_relic;success_factors;recaptcha;google_tag_manager;facebook_connect;outlook;akamai;cloud_flare","website":"cirquedusoleil.com","webvisitdatauptodateasof__c":null,"webvisitsrolling30__c":null,"what_of_covered_lives_own_a_smartphone__c":null,"whitelisting_it_contact__c":null,"worker_type__c":null,"zip":"H1Z 4M6"},"createdAt":"2018-03-02T13:43:15.973Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-21T18:26:29.653Z","archived":false}}
